The train slid with grace into platform four, barely making a sound, like trying to preserve the ambiance of the peaceful, cold evening into which it had been traveling. That peace would soon be broken though by the train’s ultimate, hard braking, which sounded like little alien babies being burned alive. Then it came to a halt. Doors started beeping, saying their goodbyes to those getting off and welcoming new faces on board. Then silence again.

It was only six in the evening, but darkness had already settled for good on this early February day. Snow had also been on the schedule, but hadn’t made its appearance yet. It felt like it was right around the corner though. Any second now.

The passenger leaned towards the window to his right, resting his thought-infested head on the generous headrest of the first class seat. The hidden heating system right under his arms provided a warm and comfortable environment, which he hoped would help him forget the happenings of the day. He wondered why he was still doing this, and then remembered that old story of the man who would always wear smaller shoes than his feet were meant to support, and which would cause him great discomfort during the day, only to enjoy the feeling of removing them in the evening. He could not help but compare this story to his own situation. Torturing himself in the madness of the corporate world during the day, only to enjoy that moment of comfort, peace and calm on the train during his way back.

There was an old man sitting on one of the benches on platform four, the passenger noticed and rested his book on his knees for a moment. He was probably in his late seventies or early eighties, judging by the depth of his wrinkled face. A walking cane was parked against the bench next to him. He was wearing old, dark brown pants, a thick gray sweater with an inaccurate design of what seemed like a reindeer knit in the front and a wool hat of the same color. He maintained a short gray beard which almost perfectly matched his sweater and hat. In his hands, he was holding a small, pink carton box with a cake inside it. He broke off a small piece with his slightly trembling fingers and started eating, chewing in slow, deliberate motions.

The old man did not notice the passenger, but for some unexplained reason, the latter found himself staring at him, fixated, following the movement of his jaw and noticing all the little crumbs that would get caught mid-air by the old man’s beard. The passenger felt like he was in a deep meditative state for a few fleeting moments there. Then, something unexpected happened: he started feeling a familiar knot in his throat. The one which manifests itself when someone is just about to start bursting into tears. He could not explain what was going on. It wasn’t like he was watching a helpless, old, homeless man for whom he felt sorry. Of course, he could indeed be homeless, but there was no way to tell. It was equally - if not more - possible that he was just an old man waiting for his train, enjoying a piece of train station quality pastry. Nonetheless, the passenger felt helpless against the wave of tears. 

He did not resist and let them come, staining his first class headrest.

The old man took another bite. Somewhere, in another universe, the train doors started beeping again and a few seconds later the train started rolling out of platform four. The passenger pushed his teary face on the cold window, trying to get a last glimpse of the old man. All he managed to get was one more second. Then he was gone. Forever.

Decades later, the passenger would still think of the man on platform four. Long dead by then, no doubt. From time to time, he would take an extra long walk to visit the exact same spot and take a seat on the same bench, like visiting the grave of a loved one. He would take one of those god-forsaken, industrial croissants and have a small break watching the trains come and go before continuing his walk, thinking that, maybe, who knows, maybe, he could also change some total stranger’s life.
