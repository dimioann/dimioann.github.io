The astronaut drifted helpless towards Jupiter in total silence, guided gently by the eternal forces of gravity. The broken pieces of the spaceship had already become a single, fading white dot in the distance. The projected screen on the visor kindly reminded her of the fact that she had only four minutes of oxygen left.

It’s all good, she thought. It was expected. At least she would not be torn apart by getting too close to Jupiter and that was a comforting thought to make during helpless situations like this.

She was surprised to notice that after the great stress and fear of escaping the collapsing ship, she now felt totally calm and at peace. She turned off the screen. She knew she was going to die soon, but had no interest in knowing the exact second. 

Jupiter was beyond beautiful. It hung there, unmoving, like a giant painting on the infinite walls of the universe’s art gallery. It was hard to imagine the terrible forces taking place down there in order to create this work of art for her eyes to witness.

She expected to get one of those speed flashbacks of her life, like they did in movies. She did not. She would, however, spend most of her last moments revisiting her past, her parents, her siblings, her friends, the children she never had. Some ridiculous, random memories would also surface, like a day at school when she was eight years old, when she was wrongly accused of breaking a window, or a scene with her stealing money from her mother’s wallet in order to buy chewing gums, or another random day - among the many - when she pretended to not see people she knew when crossing them on the street. She wondered why in Jupiter’s name her brain would play these random, insignificant memories just a few seconds before her death. 

Well, it must know better, she thought and decided to focus on her breath and on Jupiter, and observe whatever her mind was willing to serve her.

A few minutes later, she noticed herself feeling a little edgy, with the knowledge of the impending deadly punch any second now. She hoped it would not hurt much. She ordered herself to continue focusing on her breath and on Jupiter. She complied.

A couple more minutes passed and she turned on her screen. It had been nineteen minutes since she had turned it off! That wasn’t possible! She checked the oxygen counter which responded with a red flashing zero percent. In total, since the accident, she had been floating in space for more than three hours, which was easily exceeding the capacity of the suit she was wearing. The only logical explanation she could think about, was that all the sensors were wrong and that she had reduced her metabolic rate to such low levels, that she managed to prolong the expected lifetime of the supply in a profound way. She knew the probability of that scenario was almost zero, but it was still the only non-zero one that she could come up with. 

So she waited a bit more. And a bit more than that. And she continued to feel alive. She wondered if she would fall into Jupiter after all, when she finally heard the voice. “It’s all good”, it said.
