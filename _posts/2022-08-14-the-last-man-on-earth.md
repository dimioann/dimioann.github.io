“Quick! Quick! We’re gonna miss it!” the girl said, climbing the stairs, two at a time. As for me, I was paying more attention to not showing that I was struggling to follow up, than to the stairs themselves, risking a broken ankle at best, or a smashed head at worst. I was the man, I had to show strength and endurance. She - a flimsy girl with a cute little voice - couldn’t just be hopping tirelessly like Super Mario and me, a young, healthy man, sweating to death behind her.

In the end, I made it. I reached the top only a couple of steps behind her, still hoping that my exhaustion was not too obvious. It probably was. That was forty floors worth of stairs behind us. One can’t just walk all the way up without breaking a - lot of - sweat. The girl apparently did though and that made me wonder what kind of supernatural strength was hiding inside that little body of hers.

A gray metal door stood between us and the roof of the building. The door was, of course, unlocked, otherwise this story would not exist. The girl opened the door with a huge smile on her face and we found ourselves inside a deep sea of white clouds. It was so dense that we could barely see each other, less than two steps apart.

“Yes!” she exclaimed. “We are right on time! Come! Come!”

If she was expecting to find herself in such an environment, I wasn’t, so I just stood there for a few seconds, still registering my surroundings, while she disappeared into the mist. When she noticed I wasn’t following, she came back, grabbed me by the hand and pulled me along with her, deeper into the clouds. It was at that moment that I remembered that we were on the roof of a forty floor building and I resisted a little. The edge could be anywhere! And we could be over it any second now!

“Don’t worry!” she said, sensing my tentativeness and pulled me back into motion. I couldn’t help but notice once again how strong she was.

A few meters later, we stopped and she left my hand. “Are you sure we’re on time?” I asked, feeling I had stayed silent for too long.

“Yes! The clouds are going down. Can’t you see it? We’ll be over them any second now!”

Of course I could not see it, but I said nothing, waiting for something to happen and questioning my life’s choices during its past couple of hours.

Once the last line of clouds passed below my line of vision, I could then indeed notice that they were going down, faster than I would imagine clouds being capable of doing. What I was expecting to happen next, was to witness a magnificent sea of clouds below, with just a few of the highest buildings of the city peaking above it. I had seen the photographs, I knew what it looked like. I knew what to expect.

This is not at all what I got.

The sea of clouds was down there alright, but that would be as far as my expectations would match the reality of what I witnessed.

There were buildings peeking out of the clouds. Too many of them, though. Way too many. And none of them belonged to the city that I knew to exist down there. Well, none of them belonged to any human city in the world that I knew to exist down there. Their spires were thin and long and twisted in weird angles that made no engineering sense. It was like they were crafted by a toddler messing around with clay. Most of them were transparent with asymmetric decorations of all kinds of colors running along them. There were so many of them that I had a strong sense of vertigo just looking at the scene in front of me. It was an endless sea of twisted spikes. It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time.

The weirdness was not limited to the infrastructure however. After my initial shock, but still in a state of open mouthed immobility, I noticed that there were many … beings flying around everywhere. They had human bodies and a pair of large, wide wings, like butterflies. Red and gold seemed to be the most prevalent colors among them. They were flying from building to building or even vertically into and out of the thick bed of clouds. I wondered what might be hiding down there. Was there an actual earth? Actual ground? Was that all a dream? Was I hallucinating? Was I looking at a parallel universe? On a far-future planet earth?

A giant flying beast passed over our heads, blocking out the sun for a moment. It looked like a ship, or a flying whale. It let out a screaming sound that made the nerves throughout my body vibrate. It sounded more like belonging to a living creature rather than an artificial vehicle. Or maybe, an artificial, living creature? I instinctively ducked, fearing that something might fall onto my head. Thousands of little beings, possibly those flying human ones, were cruising along behind the floating colossus.

It was then that I remembered my partner in this adventure. The pretty girl that I stupidly followed without knowing virtually anything about. I turned to her. She was standing at the edge of the building, which somehow still looked like the one we just climbed. Gray and square and … logical. I couldn’t say the same about the girl. She was now naked, with red tattoos covering her body in incomprehensible shapes. She had long red hair, and red-golden wings. They looked huge from up close and I felt scared for a moment. She looked at me. I could distinguish just the slightest trace of resemblance between her and the girl with whom I had climbed those forty floors. This provided me with a tiny bit of comfort among all this madness. She looked down, then back at me again. She smiled. “Quick!” she said, in a voice that I recognised. “Come! The clouds are rising again!” And with that, she hopped over the edge and flew away, her golden wings reflecting the sunshine and making her look like some kind of a magical, alien orb from a fantasy movie. I sat there, always stunned, tracing her flight until she became a tiny point of light among a multitude of them.

The clouds soon engulfed me. Before I found the time to ask myself what on earth had just happened, they had already taken their natural position above me. I looked around. There was no sign of the girl. Then down on the ground. The buildings, the roads, the parks and the  crowds of little dark dots moving in straight lines, all looked familiar. The world that I knew was back.
