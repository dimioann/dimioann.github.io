The last man on earth was a woman. Her did not know her was the last one.

Her was standing at the top of a hill. Her buried a child under a pile of rocks. Her was weak. She’s body was showing numerous signs of decay. She’s eyes were red and she’s skin was saggy. She’s hair still stood but their were frail and weak.

When her finished with the task her removed the clothes and continued down the hill naked. The wind was hitting she from all sides. The wind was poison and it was surprising that she’s body could still keep itself up. The rocky ground was dry and rough and uneven and her would stumble and fall several times.

Her reached a river and then it started raining. The rain was toxic too. The clouds were flashing with thunder. The river was brown like the ground around itself and like the clouds over the woman. Her drank and washed the cuts on she’s skin. Her continued walking along the water and into a patch of dead trees where some tents existed. Her walked towards another body lying outside one of the tents. It was another child. Her tried to pick it up on she’s shoulder but failed. Her then started dragging it back the way her came. Her dragged but progress was not made. Her only made it until the edge of the trees. Her sat down next to the body. 

Her was alone in a dead world without colors. A tiny thing of yellow skin against infinite brownness. Her looked around and then up in the sky and then at the body lying next to she’s. Her lied down next to the child and took it dead hand into she’s. Her closed she’s eyes. There were more flashing lights in the sky now with colors her probably had never seen. Her could not see them now either. She’s eyes were closed. This is when our found she.
