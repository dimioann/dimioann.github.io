I looked down at my abused and almost bitten to the bone fingers and wondered what the hell was I doing. What the hell was I doing with them and what the hell was I doing with my life. 

The last few weeks had felt like an endless downward spiral into a bottomless pit of boredom and disappointment with pretty much everything that had to do with my existence. Apart from my fingernails, I hated my job, my house, my routine. Well, no reason beating around the bush. I just hated myself.

I would, on a daily basis, give myself promises about how things will change “from this day on”. The only thing that those achieved however, was to keep feeding my hate and self-pity by not being fulfilled or even trying to be fulfilled.

And like that, an unknown amount of days went by. It felt like time had been both accelerated and decelerated at the same time. While everything moved in a boring and repetitive manner, I vividly remember a moment when I had to pause and wonder what my age was, and for a few seconds, was incapable of finding the answer. I just could not place the current year. Then I did. Ah, already? I marveled at the answer.

I raised my eyes away from my disgusting hands and saw a little beast appear in the green space opposite to my window. It was a cat. It immediately triggered my attention and curiosity. Qualities that I had thought of as dead inside me. I was not surprised with the presence of the cat itself, as there were many of them sorry creatures that frequented the area at the back of the building. It was their place. I knew almost all of them by now and had even given names to some of them. The black widow, the ugly, the lion king, the scarface. This one however…there was something different about it. 

It must have been a newcomer, either the pet of a new neighbor moving into the building, or just another stray cat joining the gang. The little animal struck me immediately with its appearance and left me no choice regarding its name: The Arctic cat.

It was a beautiful thing. Its fur, apart from a few light brown notes on its tail, was totally white. The whitest white I had ever laid my eyes upon. The white of pure, fresh snowfall. It looked so soft and perfect. On its little, almost perfectly spherical head was a pair of deep blue eyes. I had never seen such colors before on a cat. The contrast between its fur and its eyes was so striking, almost unnatural, like a little stuffed, fluffy doll that children would cuddle with at night. It moved cautiously, exploring its new environment and finding its territory, unaware of the human being observing it from the other side of that window.

When after a few seconds my initial wow moment subsided, I ran to the drawer tower in my bedroom and started digging my way through a pile of useless stuff that I hadn’t seen or touched for years, like my life was at stake.

Then I saw the box. It was still there. I almost tore it apart and pulled the camera out of it, barely managing not to drop it on the hard floor. I ran to the window again, whispering prayers for the cat to still be there. It was. I didn’t open the window for fear of scaring it away, so I started shooting from the inside. Its fur was so white that it appeared almost luminous in my photographs. That, and the fact that my photo-shooting qualities had also been dead for ... how many months had it been? Or maybe years? The camera felt heavier than I remembered. It felt nice. I adjusted my settings and continued shooting, improving the result, little by little. 

After having captured the moment several times, I felt more confident and opened the window. The cat turned its head instinctively and looked at me with its bright blue eyes. “Amazing”, I whispered and continued shooting without a dirty, coffee stained double window between us.

About a hundred clicks later, the battery died and at that moment I realized how lucky I was that there was any charge left in the first place. The cat did not look at all threatened or disturbed by my presence and my weird behavior and walked away soon after, without a care in the world.

I shoved the memory card into my computer and anxiously waited for the pictures to be transferred. I looked at my forgotten, old camera and she looked back at me.
