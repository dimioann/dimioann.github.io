Mount Kar Ush, which if translated directly meant “The Great Silent”, was worthy of its name. The total absence of acoustic stimuli was so profound, that the sound of his shoes touching the ground made him jump on several occasions, afraid that some wild animal was on his heels, charging to eat him alive. There were many legends of unforgiving creatures living in the mountain.

He was a man of the city. He was used to neither silence nor legends.

The fog made his trek even harder. He was walking in the center of a two-meter sphere of visibility, beyond which anything could be hiding. The clouds welcomed him from the moment he entered the foothills of the mountain and never left him since. He couldn’t shake the thought that the fog was aware of his presence. Like the spirits of the mountain were watching him closely, only two meters away.

But he was a man of the city. He knew such things did not exist.

Six days and nights had passed, yet if you would ask him which one was which, it would be impossible to tell. The only thing that still proved the existence of time in a place like this, was his own growing fatigue and hunger.

On the seventh morning, the fog let him go. There was no sun in the sky, yet after six days of plowing through the clouds, even the light of a dark, cloudy day felt blinding to his eyes. He paused for a moment to allow his sight to adjust to this new world. And what a world that was. Bizarre and unwelcoming, yet inspiring and beautiful. The jagged peaks of the mountain formed cliffs that made him dizzy even watching them from the bottom, resembling the teeth of a dead, flesh-eating giant. However, the path continued along the peaks, rising gently as it circled around them like a snake. He turned around and marvelled at the sea of clouds below him. The clouds that escorted him this far, keeping their distance down the path, but still watching him. He thought that maybe the mountain did not want him to see certain things and thus sent the clouds to accompany him and guard its secrets. 

But of course such thoughts were ridiculous. After all, he was a man of the city, so he continued to push on.

Four more days passed and he ran out of food and water. But none of that mattered anymore. He knew he would reach the peak that same evening. 

There was a rocky and dry plateau at the top of the mountain. It was a unique and eerie formation to see on a mountain’s highest point. A dark smoke was coming out of its center and an equally dark figure was standing next to it. He was not surprised by that. He knew exactly who to expect there. It was the Old Man.

“You are the man of the city”, the Old Man said without looking at him when he approached. His voice was deep and clear, not resembling that of a man of this age. “Sit down. There, close to the fire, it’s getting dark and cold”.

There was no visible fire. Only black smoke coming out of a little hole in the ground.

“You are the Old Man?” the man of the city asked.

“You came to look at it”, the Old Man said, ignoring his stupid question. “Everyone that makes the long journey is given a chance. Go ahead then. Look.”

He hesitated for a moment and allowed a stream of doubts to take over his mind. Was this what he really wanted? Would it solve his problem? Was this all an overreaction? Could it be that maybe, there was an alternative solution to this? 

The man of the city took a step closer to the smoke and looked at the Old Man who had now closed his eyes and looked almost unaware of his presence. His skin was dark brown and lacked any trace of hair. His face was deeply wrinkled and scarred and transmitted a sense of immense wisdom, peace and indifference.

The man of the city looked back at the smoke and took one more step towards it.

One more. Almost next to it now.

A moment of hesitation, a pause and a step back.

He heard the Old Man making a soft sound and turned to look at him, but the Old Man was not there anymore. He turned to the smoke, but that was gone as well. The only thing left was a small hole in the ground. “No!” he said between his teeth. He fell on the ground next to the hole and tried to look into it, but if there was something there to be seen, it wasn’t there anymore. “No!” he repeated, louder.

He was a man of the city on the highest peak of Kar Ush and he was out of food and water.
