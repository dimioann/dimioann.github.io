I was walking back from the train station after another day of indistinguishable mediocrity at the office. I was commuting by train those days in order to force myself into reading a little bit. Reading was an old habit of mine that had been  unconsciously replaced with infinite scrolling and random video watching at some undetermined point in time. I wasn’t sure since when. Nobody does. On the train, for whatever reason, I had found out that it was easier reading. It was like they were meant for that.

I turned the corner into my street, looking mindlessly at my phone at the same time as one always does. It was late and the place was dead silent, as rich suburbs always are. On the contrary of what you would expect of a rich suburb street however, one out of three street lights were out of order. 

A few corners before reaching the house, I decided that enough was enough with my phone - at least until I reached the door- and buried it in my pocket. I raised my head and looked in front of me for a change. 

The night was calm, there was a slight, almost pleasant chill in the air and there was someone in the middle of the street outside my house. I took a couple of steps before my brain fully registered its presence and then I froze. In fact, I could not decide if it was someone or something and the poorly lit road did not help me at all. All I could see was a tall dark silhouette. Too tall, I concluded, terrified. Too tall to be a human being. It was standing on its two legs, reaching almost three meters in height, all black and terrifying. It just stood there, frozen like myself, looking at me. I could barely make out two reflective circles where its eyes apparently were. I thought of making a run for my door, but shaking was the only move my body would allow itself to perform at that moment.

The encounter lasted only for a few seconds, which to me felt like a few centuries. That was when my eyes had adjusted to the darkness well enough to distinguish what was actually over there. What I saw did not comfort me at all. I was looking at a goat. A giant, black goat, standing on its two back legs. Its horns twisted and horrifying, its eyes black as empty space and its hooves monstrous and deadly. 

Similar to my eyesight, my hearing had also adjusted to the silence by that moment. I could hear my heart beating like a solo drum and I could hear the goat thing’s breathing as well. It was slow and heavy. I could now also notice the vapors of its hot breath against the cold air. In the middle of my fear I couldn't notice anything else, but when replaying the scene in my head a million times after the event, I could not help but make out tones of tiredness and sickness in that breathing.

Its eyes turned red for a moment and I thought that that was the perfect cue for me to get the hell out of there. But the black goat acted first. It turned around with an awkward twist of its body that no human or animal was supposed to be able to perform, jumped over a fence at the opposite side of the road and disappeared into the darkness.

Needless to say that I barely slept that night. It was also the first time that I questioned my so far non-negotiable decision of always living alone.

Apart from the first couple of days, I had no more trouble sleeping and life would soon get back to its precious routine. One thing I changed from day one however, was to drive to wherever I needed to be and then drive back directly into my garage. Some nights I would also catch myself peeking out the front window. There was nothing interesting to see there and I was glad about it.

Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, things did not stay like this forever and about a month or two later, the goat returned. It stood there in the middle of the dark street, like the night when I first stumbled upon it. From my vantage point and thanks to the lack of proper lighting, I could not tell if the thing was looking towards my window and me, or towards the opposite direction. It stayed there for a minute and then jumped off with the same jerky movement like the other night. I wonder if anyone else in the neighborhood saw this. I thought of calling someone, but who do you call in cases like this? The police? And what could I possibly say to them?

After its departure, I noticed a dark line on the surface of the road where it had crossed and a larger stain in the middle of it, right where it had stood. The thing was bleeding. 

Like a fool that I am, I went out to verify my suspicion and indeed that was the case. I bent to have a closer look, preparing myself for a terrible stink, but there was no odor of any kind, just blood. Questioning my motives of being there and after deciding that I had seen enough, I got back on my feet. I looked at the other side of the street and saw the black goat looking back at me, half-hidden behind a tree. It screamed a horrible sound that made all my body hair stand at attention. This time I managed to break my paralysis and ran back home while the goat repeated its stomach wrenching scream. I looked back out the window, fearing that it had followed me, but there was nothing.

It came again the next evening. This time I couldn’t see it, but I could hear its screams. I booked a hotel in the city center for a week and left the next morning.

I managed to take my mind off of this madness for a few days, but the hotel was not a viable long term solution. I thought of staying with a relative or a friend, but even if I could come up with a made-up excuse to hide the true reason, I could not think of anyone whom I would feel comfortable enough asking for such a favor. The journey home was inevitable.

It was a cloudy, dry Sunday morning. The blood traces on the street seemed to have been washed away at some point, but the blood traces on my kitchen floor looked fresh. The blood was mixed with a million pieces of glass from the destroyed door. They looked like little bloody teeth. I immediately grabbed the largest knife I could find and followed the bloody traces upstairs all the way to my bedroom. The goat was lying on my bed, breathing heavily and bleeding to death. I don’t know if it ever got aware of my presence that morning. It was an unreal, nightmare scene that made no sense, but I couldn’t help but find it sad as well. I let the knife fall on the floor and I ran away. Back to my car and back to the hotel.

Four days later, two men approached me in the hotel’s cafe, identifying themselves as police officers. They would like to ask me if I knew a woman named Jane Black. I did. We had a one-week relationship a few months ago, but I instinctively answered that I did not know her. I don’t know why. That would cost me dearly later on. They insisted that it would be better if we continued the discussion at the police station.

Eventually, I had no other option but to recount the story of the black goat in court. Nobody believed me, of course. They all thought I was playing the “crazy” card in order to get a lighter sentence. The professionals testified that there was nothing that would qualify me as a crazy person. There was nothing I could cling my case onto and the twenty years were inevitable.

I got out at seventeen. Those endless years in a cell, would only increase my confusion about what happened during those days. But for one thing I’m certain: the black goat was real. I know it, because there is another one. It’s in there, in the bedroom. It’s bleeding to death again. But this time I won’t run. I’m not spending another twenty years in prison. This time, I’ll take my measures.
